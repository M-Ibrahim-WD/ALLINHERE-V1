## Theme Customization

Basic theme options can be configured via the WordPress Customizer (**Appearance > Customize**).

*   Here you can upload your site logo. The theme supports a flexible-width logo.

### Theme Colors

## Using Elementor

ALLINHERE is a lightweight foundation theme, giving you the freedom to design your site with Elementor.
*   **Creating Pages:** When you create a new page or edit an existing one, click the "Edit with Elementor" button to launch the Elementor editor.
*   **Elementor Page Templates:** For full control over the layout, Elementor provides page templates like:
    *   **Elementor Canvas:** A completely blank template without your theme's header or footer. Ideal for landing pages.
    *   **Elementor Full Width:** Uses your theme's header and footer but gives you a full-width content area.
*   **Elementor Documentation:** For detailed information on using Elementor, please refer to the official [Elementor Documentation](https://elementor.com/help/).

## Child Theming

If you plan to make code customizations to the theme (e.g., modifying template files, adding custom CSS beyond the Customizer options), it is highly recommended to use a **child theme**. This ensures that your customizations are not lost when the parent ALLINHERE theme is updated.

You can create a basic child theme manually or use a plugin to generate one.

## Support

As this is a custom-developed theme, direct support channels may vary. Please refer to the author's website or the repository where you obtained the theme for any support inquiries.
